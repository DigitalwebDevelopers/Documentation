<h2 class="sub_topics">🌟 What is React?</h2>

<p class="page_paras"><strong>React.js</strong> (commonly known as <strong>React</strong>) is an open-source JavaScript library used for building fast, interactive, and dynamic user interfaces, especially for single-page applications (SPAs). It was developed by Facebook and is maintained by Facebook and a community of developers.</p>

<p class="page_paras">React allows developers to create large web applications that can update and render efficiently in response to changing data, without reloading the page.</p>

<h2 class="sub_topics">❓ Why Learn React?</h2>

<p class="page_paras">React has become one of the most popular libraries in the front-end development world. Here are some compelling reasons to learn React:</p>

<ul class="linked_list">
  <li class="ul_childs">✅ <strong>Component-Based Architecture</strong>: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state.</li>
  <li class="ul_childs">⚡ <strong>Fast Performance</strong>: React uses a virtual DOM to optimize rendering and improve performance.</li>
  <li class="ul_childs">🔁 <strong>Reusable Code</strong>: Components can be reused, reducing duplication and making code more maintainable.</li>
  <li class="ul_childs">🌐 <strong>Strong Community and Ecosystem</strong>: Huge community support, tons of libraries and tools.</li>
  <li class="ul_childs">💼 <strong>High Demand in Job Market</strong>: Most modern companies use React in production.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="sub_topics">🧠 Prerequisites</h2>

<p class="page_paras">Before diving into React, it's important to have a good understanding of the following:</p>

<ul class="linked_list">
  <li class="ul_childs">🔹 <strong>HTML/CSS</strong> – Layout and styling basics</li>
  <li class="ul_childs">🔹 <strong>JavaScript (ES6+)</strong> – Especially topics like:
    <ul class="linked_list">
      <li class="ul_childs">Variables (<code>let</code>, <code>const</code>)</li>
      <li class="ul_childs">Arrow functions</li>
      <li class="ul_childs">Destructuring</li>
      <li class="ul_childs">Array methods (<code>map</code>, <code>filter</code>)</li>
      <li class="ul_childs">Promises and async/await</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="ul_childs">🔹 <strong>DOM Manipulation</strong> – Understanding how elements are accessed and manipulated</li>
  <li class="ul_childs">🔹 <strong>Basic Git/GitHub</strong> – For version control and collaboration (optional but helpful)</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="sub_topics">🛠️ How React Works</h2>

<p class="page_paras">React follows a <strong>declarative</strong> approach. Instead of telling the browser <em>how</em> to do things step-by-step (imperative), you describe <em>what</em> the UI should look like, and React takes care of rendering it efficiently.</p>

<p class="page_paras">React uses:</p>

<ul class="linked_list">
  <li class="ul_childs"><strong>JSX</strong> – A syntax extension that looks like HTML but works in JavaScript.</li>
  <li class="ul_childs"><strong>Components</strong> – Reusable blocks of code that return elements to be rendered.</li>
  <li class="ul_childs"><strong>State and Props</strong> – Mechanisms to pass and manage data within and between components.</li>
  <li class="ul_childs"><strong>Hooks</strong> – Functions like <code>useState</code>, <code>useEffect</code> that manage component lifecycle and logic in functional components.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="sub_topics">🚀 Getting Started</h2>

<p class="page_paras">To start learning React, you can:</p>

<ol class="linked_list">
  <li class="ul_childs">Install Node.js and npm</li>
  <li class="ul_childs">Use <code>create-react-app</code> to scaffold a new project:
    <pre><code>npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
    </code></pre>
  </li>
  <li class="ul_childs">Start learning component creation, JSX, props, and state management.</li>
</ol>
